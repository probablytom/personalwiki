## This is everything I know

A "second brain" is a knowledge management technique that's getting incredibly popular. It's a method for storing knowledge where everything that a person knows is noted, and links are made between different \[related!] pieces of knowledge. This is mine.

It's inspired by a few things I've read and informed by a few different attempts I've made over the years, but _this_ incarnation is based mostly on two things: [digital gardening](knowledge/productivity/personal-knowledge-management/digital-gardening.md) and [Nikita Voloboev's own GitBook second brain](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz).

I'm using this space to record everything I know, and everything I learn over time. As a result the notes are made _for my own record_ and not necessarily to be of help to you. Sorry! That said, I think they will be helpful to anybody reading. If future me has to read a page, having forgotten everything he's thought about on a given topic, the page needs to be written comprehensively enough by present me that he'll be right up to speed. "Future me" could be anybody and could know / have forgotten anything, so I've _effectively_ written this with a stranger in mind.

There are topics I'm collecting together in the sidebar; the best way to navigate this is to use that to find anything you'd like to read my notes on.
