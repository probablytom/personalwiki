# Minsky — Why People Think Computers Can't

[Can be read here.](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/polanyi/Polanyi\_Life\_Structures.pdf)

## Reading Notes

* The people who built the first computers were interested in their capacity to perform lots of computation, and so these engineers and mathematicians called them "computers" - but in reality their biggest strength might be their capacity to manipulate symbols, not values.
* "There's a big difference between 'impossible' and 'hard to imagine'. The first is about _it_; the second is about _you_!"
* Arguably, the important thing is how one learns to learn. Better learning techniques act as a force-multiplier on the effort of learning. Minsky posits that genius is likely often a child’s early recognition of faster ways to learn, given time to flourish.
* He notes that people often misunderstand a computer’s capacities. Surely it only does calculations? No logic. It does logic? Surely no analogy-based reasoning though. They can do that? Bah — it’s unimportant anyway!
* He also thinks to ask about whether a machine “understands”, say, human speech is to focus on the wrong thing.
	* “…here, I think, they only point to a maze of superstitions, which handicapped our predecessors when they tried to figure out what “meanings” are and how they get connected to our words.”
	* “Any physiologically realistic theory of meanings needs built-in ways to deal wi5 individual differences between the people who are to do the ‘knowing’.”
