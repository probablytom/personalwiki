## Reading Notes

* The people who built the first computers were interested in their capacity to perform lots of computation, and so these engineers and mathematicians called them "computers" - but in reality their biggest strength might be their capacity to manipulate symbols, not values.
* "There's a big difference between 'impossible' and 'hard to imagine'. The first is about _it_; the second is about _you_!"
