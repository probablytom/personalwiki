# Michael Pollan — Caffeine

This book's about caffeine — how it works, its effects, and its impact on a person who might take it, told largely through the story of the author's own cold-turkey abstinence from caffeine. It's well-researched (as Michael Pollan's books are want to be) and an enjoyable listen.

Oh — on "listen" — this is an audible exclusive. Nobody's less disappointed than me.

## Reading notes

* I love the way he starts by casting doubt on the book itself. Beginning a piece with the author's own crisis of confidence is, well, quite a confident move.&#x20;
  * It also introduces the fact that he stops using caffeine well.
  * Paraphrasing, "What didn't occur to me was that, by stopping taking caffeine, I'd removed my own ability to tell the story of stopping taking caffeine."
* When bees are exposed to a scent after drinking nectar, they will remember scents presented after caffeinated nectar more easily/readily/frequently than with non-caffeinated nectar.
  * Even when it's not tasteable!
  * This means bees would be attracted to caffeine-producing plants more than uncaffeinated ones.
  * They even return to these plants when there's no nectar left!
* "An uncomfortable question arises: could we humans be in the same boat as those hapless bees? Have we, too, been duped by caffeined plants, to do their bidding and act against our own interests?"
  * Has the adoption of caffeine been a boon or a bane to human civillisation? And to our species, which is clearly a different question.
* Coffee houses brought about a new public space. They were less rowdy, people generally had high-minded discussions about news and modern knowledge, and so on — very different to pubs, where people were more likely to fight than have gentle discussion.
  * Uppers vs. downers!
