# Racket

I think everybody would agree that the most interesting lisps on the block right now are Racket and [Clojure](clojure.md). Between the two, I personally find Racket most interesting: it's lightweight and straightforward, uncomplicated by things like the JVM (for better or worse). Racket's still got an active community, and the language gets used in what I think are the best problems for lisp to be used on: personal problems.

In a way, this is a polite way of saying that I haven't seen Racket used much for "professional" engineering. I don't see why this would be a problem. The flip-side is that it's unburdened by the needs of professional engineers, meaning that the language has remained simple, its tooling unintimidating, and its community positive and welcoming.

* [Beautiful Racket](https://beautifulracket.com), by Matthew Butterick, is absolutely lovely.
  * It also introduced me to the concept of "Language-oriented programming", which I'd explain as the concept that, rather than implementing a solution to a problem, a better approach is often implementing a language that permits elegant solutions to that problems (or others in a family it belongs to).
* I describe Racket's community as "positive and welcoming" but, well, [Butterick has some writing on that too](https://beautifulracket.com/appendix/why-i-no-longer-contribute-to-racket.html). There's certainly trouble in paradise.
* [An introduction to Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/) in pictures that reminds me of some early programming classes I took at university.
* [The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf) is a classic lisp intro book for SCheme, Racket's spiritual predecessor.
* I always thought [Realm of Racket](https://www.realmofracket.com) was a good idea: it's a book teaching kids Racket through game development. A similar book finally got me into Python as a teenager.
