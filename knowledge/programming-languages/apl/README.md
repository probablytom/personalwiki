# APL

The brainchild of Iverson, this was a language made with two things in mind:

1. As [a notation that could also be a tool for thinking in](../../../reading-notes/papers/iverson-notation-as-a-tool-of-thought.md)
2. A potential replacement for traditional mathematical notations.

Note that there's another in the APL family that's been gaining some traction lately, called J.

{% content-ref url="j.md" %}
[j.md](j.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Notes

* [APL doesnt really support higher-order functions but there are hacks around custom-defined operators or namespaces thst can get you similar features.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19845964/pass-function-as-an-argument-in-apl)
