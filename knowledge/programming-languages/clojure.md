# Clojure

A Lisp that runs on the JVM, written & designed by Rich Hickey. This language actually sees commercial success, which is unusual for a lisp! I think its adoption of Java's ecosystem and interoperability with other JVM-based languages are to thank for that (as well as Rich Hickey's excellent language design work).
