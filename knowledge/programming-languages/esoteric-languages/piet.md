# Piet

A fun language, where programs are graphical. They're pictures that look like a painting by Piet Mondrian. I love the idea of a graphic being executable; it's a good example of how, while programmers typically work with text, we absolutely don't have to (and I wonder whether there are better alternatives).

I believe the original definition can be found on this page on [dangermouse.net](https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html).

Some examples can be found [on the same person's site](https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet/samples.html), and some are very cool!
