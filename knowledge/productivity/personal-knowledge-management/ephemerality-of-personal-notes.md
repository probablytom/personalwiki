# Ephemerality of personal notes

It occurs to me that personal knowledge management usually involves some kind of ephemerality. We can make notes for many reasons, and we can create a binary classification for those notes:

1. Notes can be made because they have use _in the moment_, but are intended to have a finite lifespan i.e. they're not to be "kept". They can be discarded once they've fulfilled their purpose.
2. Notes can be made with longevity in mind, either because they're intended for reference in an indefinite period of time, they capture something timeless, something is contained within them that one doesn't want to forget, or they're produced with the intention of maintainance over time as they age.

I call notes that fall into the first category "[ephemeral](../../mental-tools/ephemerality.md)". The ephemerality of a note changes how we should interact with that note. Ephemeral notes typically don't require:

* Longevity
* Searchability
  * There are exceptions to this. For example, an ephemeral note that you intend to revisit exactly once, but at an indefinite point in the future.
* Easy access from anywhere
* Systems for updating the note over time

People usually make ephemeral notes on scrap pieces of paper or post-it notes, and these are naturally ephemeral. When we write blogs, maintain [digital gardens](digital-gardening.md), or take part in any other kind of personal knowledge management, we run the risk of hoarding all of our notes, ephemerality be damned. This risks cutting signal with additional noise when we want to make use of a knowledge base in the future.

A curated knowledge base is not the same as a collected knowledge base: collections are added to over time, but curations are pruned back when needs be. Curation is the process of deciding whether something is _important_; collecting is adding to a set when something appears interesting.

Making the distinction of ephemerality in note-taking is an important step in automatically curating the contents of a knowledge base: avoiding adding notes that don't ask to be added in the first place.
