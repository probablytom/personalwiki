# Personal Knowledge Management

Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) has become very popular lately, and there's been a modern resurgence for a few reasons:

1. It presents an alternative way of interacting with the modern web
2. It _was_ popular! [Digital Gardening](digital-gardening.md) was an early cousin of blogging, and has now been rolled into a lot of discussions around Zettelkasten.
3. As people increasingly live and work digitally, an increasing number of people are struggling with becoming knowledge workers.

PKM often involves tracking things like what you know and what you need to do.
