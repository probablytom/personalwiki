# Shifting Baselines

Shifting Baseline Syndrome is the name given to an explanation for our seeing the world differently to our parents, in a way. The premise is this: you understand the world according to what you acclimatise to from a young age. As a result, what's seen as rapid change brought about in "modern times" by older generations is seen as normal by a young generation.
