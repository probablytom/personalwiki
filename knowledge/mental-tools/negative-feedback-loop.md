# Negative Feedback Loop

Feedback loops iterate over an effect to alter their impact, with the effect typically triggering or feeding into the altering process again. Negative feedback loops diminish the effect through repetition. [See Wikipedia for more.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative\_feedback?wprov=sfti1) The same concept, but magnifying effects, is called a [Positive feedback loop](positive-feedback-loop.md).
