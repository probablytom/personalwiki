# Ephemerality

While I studied in my undergraduate degree, the maths building was knocked down. It was to be replaced by a new "learning hub" which would take five years to build in the end. This meant the entire mathematics department had to find a new home, for at least those five years.

What the university did was to find a small plot of land that it could very quickly produce a new building on. This new building was only intended to last about 10 years, as a stopgap between the old building and the new learning hub. That made it cheap and effective, without committing that land or leaving an entire department without a home.

The building was designed to be _ephemeral_: to have a finite lifespan by design.

Easily confused with [Transience](transcience.md), where things naturally have a limited lifespan, but are created with the intention of having an indefinite one, necessitating maintenance.
