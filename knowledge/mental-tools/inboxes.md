# Inboxes

Inboxes are used for capture. The notion is that something no of interest is collected over time in an inbox, then processed at a later time in a batch. Often, they are time-ordered so as to prioritise older entries on processing.

These effectively come up anywhere with intentional accumulation or backlog. For example, orders at a restaurant often get sorted in a similar manner. Reading lists too. A queue is effectively an inbox of people: they accumulate in line, and wait in order of arrival for later processing.
