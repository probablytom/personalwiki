# Compounding

It always feels so trite to read about the impact of compounding when I do, but the fact of the matter is that it's a real force. It's why habits are so effective (or desctructive!), which is a real life lesson in and of itself.

The principle is this: small effects become large when iterated. Running a mile is a reasonably solid place to begin running, but it makes you stronger. Say the next time you run, you can run 2% further â€” for three runs a week, for 52 weeks, you'd run 22.5 miles. _Nearly a marathon_!

The key component of this is that the act of running has an impact on the following run. The action has an effect that feeds into itself. This happens to form a Positive feedback loop.
