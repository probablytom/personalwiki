# Epistemic Humility

"Epistemic Humility" is the concept of being humble about what you truely know.

To clarify: Epistemic humility is _not_ doubting your own beliefs. Humble â‰  unsure. Rather, it's to believe what you know, but to hold an additional belief: that there might be things you don't know or aren't considering which contradict what you presently believe.

Epistemic humility is a useful tool to live life with, as it can lead to new realisations all the time. It's particularly useful as a listening device though. In a situation where you're faced with somebody with different beliefs to your own, it gives you the opportunity to learn about, empathise with, or simply acknowledge another point of view. You might even find with this tool that you prefer the other perspective to your own!

You also might not. Any belief is held for a reason, and just as often as you're wrong, you're likely right, too. In a way the tool can also help to build confidence in what you do believe, because it can become battle-tested against other people's perspectives. If you've heard lots of arguments against something you hold to be true and none of them stuck, while being truely epistemically humble, it's much easier to have faith in your perspective holding a real nugget of truth: nothing can knock it off its figurative pedestal.

Because of this, Epistemic Humility is a great way of iterating toward true, justified beliefs, or a baseline that shifts toward truth.
