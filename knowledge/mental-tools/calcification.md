# Calcification

Sometimes things change in such a way that they can't change anymore. There's a special pattern to the way this happens, where it's slow, affecting gradually more and more of its subject until the whole thing is stuck in a kind of rigor mortis.

"Calcify" is a verb meaning this slow settling of things and processes, and I find it useful. Gradually becoming harder to change is a more common thing than you might expect. Having a word for it makes it easier to identify in the world, and it's a good addition to anybody's [Mental Toolbox](mental-toolbox.md).
