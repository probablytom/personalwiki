# Transcience

Many things naturally ebb away over time, are designed to do so, or require maintainance to avoid their gradual dilution or loss. On a grand enough scale, all things fit into this category, but we don't typically consider the lifetime of a building as meaningfully limited: we can reasonably expect them to stand around indefinitely.

We can't meaningfully expect other things to remain indefinitely sans maintainance. Friendships are the ones that always come to mind: without care and regular input, they naturally dissipate. It would be unreasonable to expect a friendship to remain indefinitely. Many skills are the same: playing musical instruments, speaking languages, perhaps artistic talent.

Put differently, transient things are intended to have an indefinitely long lifetime, but naturally degrade over time.

The need for maintenance isn't a groundbreaking observation but it's easy to forget where that effort should be focused. For that, it's helpful to identify transient things.

Not to be confused with [Ephemerality](ephemerality.md), where things have a transient property but no maintenance is intended, as we don't typically want to keep them around (or design them with an indefinite lifetime in mind).
