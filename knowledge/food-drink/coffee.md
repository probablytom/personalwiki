# Coffee

Coffee! Caffeine! It's the most magical drink in my cupboard.

## Brewing Methods

### V60

* [Matt Perger's V60 brewing method](https://vimeo.com/channels/262119/46612013) is my favourite. It gives good results, reliably, and it's easy to learn and demonstrate to other people. It's quite forgiving too. The issue? I suppose the brews are too small and arguably too slow (per ml brewed) to be used in a commercial setting. This is not a problem for my personal use.
* [The 40/60 method](https://en.philocoffea.com/blogs/blog/coffee-brewing-method) that recently became more popular is arguably quite similar!
* James Hoffman is very popular! [His V60 method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4ynXzkSQo) is also reliable, and with a little effort can be dialled into smaller brews.

### Other brewing paraphenalia



## Coffee roasters I like

### London

* Grind London

### Glasgow

* Papercup
* Dear Green
* Thompsons
* Gordon St. Coffee still does some darker stuff if that's your jam
* Grain & Grind does some curious stuff (chinese coffee!), but generally it lacks nuance etc flavour-wise.

### Edinburgh

* Artisan Roast
* Fortitude
