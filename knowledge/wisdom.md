# Wisdom

Inspired by Matthew Butterick's advice on getting CV feedback:

> When getting feedback on any work, to avoid getting a "looks good to me!" response, insist before they look at it that you require at least three suggestions for improvement. They might not have three pieces if advice to give, but they'll give at least one.


From [this imgur repository of folks' insights from their own therapy](https://imgur.com/gallery/t9bx2Z2):

> Your brain is responsible for keeping you alive, not keeping you happy. You have to be intentional about bringing joy into your life.

> Perfectionism can actually be insecurity about how your best efforts will be received.

> Treat yourself when you're going through a hard time the same way you'd treat a friend who's going through a hard time.

From Ted Lasso:

> Youth is wasted on the young; don't let the wisdom of age be wasted on you. 

From "The Good Book", by A. C. Grayling

> W

Ed Catmull:

> Success hides problems.


[John Siracusa adds](https://pca.st/episode/ff7a17be-fe56-4eb5-bc3e-cc1c5c38f07b?t=4575.0):

> …so does silence.


Ted Lasso S01E02:

> The world's happiest animal is a goldfish. Why? Because they have a ten second memory. Be a goldfish.


From a Reddit comment by u/MisterBadIdea2:


> Be wary of mistaking credentials in one field for authority in another.


From Merlin Mann on [Do By Friday , "Dust On The Telescope"](https://pca.st/episode/658d35d0-c150-0134-10c4-25324e2a541d):


> When you're doing something, ask yourself whether it's making you more or less the person you want to be. "Does exercising make me more or less the person I want to be? Does being on Twitter three hours a day make me more or less the person I want to be?"


From [this article on boring advice](http://nywkap.com/other/follow-boring-advice.html):

> We are what we do, not what we think we are. Taking an imperfect action now is more important than thinking about it forever.

> Most of the good things come from building a habit or a process and trusting it.

> Doing the wrong thing consistently leads nowhere. From time to time, it’s important to stop, reflect, readjust and continue in the right direction.

> Compounding doesn’t only work in finance, but also in life. Even the tiniest of steps compound over time.

> When practicing to get better at something, it’s important to do so deliberately: pushing a little bit further every time, with short feedback loops, and focus.

> Focusing on one thing at a time. Having one, clear goal. Eliminating distractions and impulses.

> Most hard things become manageable when split into small, actionable steps.

> Genuine positivity and optimism work wonders. Positive people are attractive. Practicing gratitude brings peace of mind.

[Some notes on email](https://joshspector.com/one-sentence-email-tips/):

> The simplest way to get fewer emails is to send fewer emails. 

> The more your email sounds how you speak, the more effective you will be. 

> The worst time to "do email" is every time you get an email.

> There's such a thing as too much email

> You don't always have to reply.

> Nobody ever says, "I wish the paragraphs in that email were longer".

From Merlin Mann, not sure exactly where and paraphrasing:

> There's no such place as "away". When you throw something away you're still putting it somewhere else, it doesn't magically disappear. Remembering that every time you open a bin will make you feel very differently about waste.

From [this tweet](https://twitter.com/anthilemoon/status/1443485224092913669):

> If you feel like you lack time, you most likely lack focus.

From Ted Lasso, S02E12: in conflicts and confrontations, it can be aid communication to ask:

> What have I got to learn here?

origin unknown:

> Actions express priorities.
